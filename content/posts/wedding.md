Hello everyone,
We had a small wedding in February, but we want a big celebration with you! That's why we would like to invite you on September 13, 2025 at 1:00 PM.

## “Okay, but where?”

Velký Mlýn!

## “What will happen?”

1:00 PM Start
2:00 PM Vows
6:00 PM Cake cutting
And then? Party!

(We have to finish at 12:00 PM but I don't know if we write that here)

## “How can we help you?”

We are not planning anything complicated, but if you would like to show off your culinary skills, we would be very happy for sweet and savory treats!
Otherwise, food, beer, wine and soft drinks will be taken care of. And coffee will be provided in the café one floor above us.

## “Celebration? And music?!”

We will have instruments and equipment for a jam session and a regular speaker. But be careful, we have veto power over the playlist!

## “What about gifts? And the dress code?”

We would love for you to come and have a great time with us. If you couldn’t help but want to give us something, we would be happy to contribute to the renovation of the apartment.

There is no dress code, come in whatever way you feel comfortable and pleasant!

We look forward to seeing you all!
