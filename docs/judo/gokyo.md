The gokyo is essentially the 40 techniques originally written by [Jigoro Kano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kan%C5%8D_Jigor%C5%8D) for his standard syllabus. These techniques are organised into 5 different sets and there are additional sets for newer techniques which were added in 1982.

## Personal note

My personal endeavour is to paint each of the 40 techniques during the year 2026 and add details for each of them. This is in parallel of my regular trainings and more of a fun task to get back into watercolour painting.

## 1st group

Also called dai-ikkyo.

### De-ashi-harai or de-ashi-barai
