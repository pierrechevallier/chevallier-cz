[Judo is called "the gentle way"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo), and it's for a reason on relying on your opponent's force to throw them (and rather not using your own strength).

This page is about _my_ gentle way, as well as, some focus on my favourite technique or at least the techniques I've focused on before and will focus on for the future. For this year (2026), my objective is to focus on ^^[ippon-seoi-nage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQnOlCxo4oI)^^.

I'll add a list of some techniques I am focusing on as well as notes about them.

!!! tip "Tokui-waza"

    [tokui-waza]("favourite techniques"), is your favourite technique, or the one you feel the most used to. It can arise through your personnal work or just naturally as your judo evolves.

## Sasae-tsurikomi-ashi

A great foot technique that can be used as a setup as well as a main throw. One of the great things about sasae (and potentially hiza-guruma because they share loosely the same mechanics), is that it can double as a forward throw by continuing the rotation beyond the blocking of the foot.

This is one of the setup throws I like because you can hit it from a very wide range of grips as well as both sides.

## Harai-goshi

I wanted to make it my tokui-waza, because it's a beautiful throw, unfortunately I can't use it reliably in randori, so I am leaving it as a work in progress until I find a way of making it manageable.

During 2025, I have taken a lot of notes about harai-goshi, so I'll add them here.

## Ippon-seoi-nage

This is the throw I will focus on my year 2026, it's not only the one that got me thrown in my December 2025 competition, but it's also a throw that I used to loathe and now I'm getting more and more to like. Let's add some notes.
