# Combinations of techniques

Commonly known as [renraku-waza](https://www.judo-ch.jp/english/dictionary/terms/renraku/), the combination of different techniques is used to train from the orange belt in how to throw an opponent by combining 2 techniques.

Other types exists such as:

- renzoku-waza: combination of the same technique, essentially doing the same technique twice
- gaeshi-waza: counter to the technique of an opponent

## Example of combinations

We have some combinations of techniques which are pretty commonly trained at dojos:

1. ko-uchi-gari -> o-uchi-gari
2. o-goshi -> tai-otoshi
3. o-soto-gari -> o-uchi-gari

We can then look at other techniques as well.

## Ideas of structure for your exams

Generally, the sensei for the grading **won't like too many repetitions** (if you do always a technique leading to ippon-seoi-nage, they'll question what you are doing).

A good thing to do is to focus on your tokui-waza (favourite technique) and work on other techniques as well. It's better to think about what you effectively use in randori (free practice, sparring) or in shiai (competition).

Another aspect that senseis like is the mix of different techniques: ashi (leg and foot sweeps), goshi (hip throws), te (hand and hand focused throws) and sutemi (sacrifice throws).
About the latter, it might be better not to add too many of those for the exams as you tend to have to also get up with your uke. It's alright, but better to keep it as a last technique potentially.
