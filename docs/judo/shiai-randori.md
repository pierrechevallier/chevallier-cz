These are my thoughts on sparring and competition, obviously take it as you may with my limited experience in judo.

## Randori or sparring

Sparring in the dojo, technically referred as playing from Jigoro Kano's perspective.

When going to a randori session for a class, think ahead what you want to achieve and set small goals, given your experience obviously:

- "I want to hit a forward throw"
- "Let's make this setup work from ko-uchi"
- "I want to be able to apply my best grip"
- "I want to work on a grip my opponent feeds me and try to escape from it"
- etc.

## Shiai or competition

This is supposed to be where you show your best skills and test yourself.
