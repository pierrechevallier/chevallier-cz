## Revival or returning to writting

Initially, this blog was created over 6 years ago, a bit before COVID at a time I thought would be great to share fresh ideas I had. I was building a BI application with open source software and learning the ropes on some infrastructure as code.

Then, I was also perhaps a bit lacking in quite a lot of area in IT, but I had a sharp mind for programming. Now I have learnt a bit more but I am STILL lacking in quite of lot of area in IT, data processing; governance, security... [Well nobody's perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Inp_sWsUqQ&pp=ygUhbm9ib2R5J3MgcGVyZmVjdCBzb21lIGxpa2UgaXQgaG90).

The issue is that over the past 2 years, AI and LLMs are everywhere, suggesting code to programmers, compiling notes, being talked as the new frontier in technology and a revolution. There is something to learn in that space and maybe this is the place where I'll start to write.

A page is turning at the end of this year, and I am reviving this blog for that. Let's see how far I can take it.
