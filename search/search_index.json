What I did was taking all the development variable and progressively switch them to their opposite value until, well, the development would break.</p> <p>It did, <code>sideEffects: true</code> was in fact causing an issue and using <code>sideEffects: false</code> was a solution.

Overall, reduce the salt and the carbs intake (pasta for example) a good chunk of time prior to competing. Typically I would eat a bit less (skip maybe the breakfasts and avoid anything caloric like sodas, alcohol, cakes etc.), try to sleep as much as I can and 2 days before the competition almost switch all the dirnking to tea (mostly black tea), to reduce the water weight. A good way for me to also lose a kilo or two is to run a 5k at a good speed and sweat it out.</p> <p>I prefer the weigh-in on the night before the competition, have a light meal in the evening (something like a soup and maybe a salad or something with protein) and avoid heavy food before.</p>"},{"location":"judo/shiai-randori/#day-of-the-competition","title":"Day of the competition","text":""},{"location":"judo/shiai-randori/#what-to-bring","title":"What to bring","text":"<p>Necessary:</p> <ul> <li>So obviously... bring your (white) gi and possibly a blue one if needed for some competitions.

Then you can do a couple of randori with people from your club or somebody you know.

One opponent imposes a narrative on the other and vice-versa and a certain pattern of attacks or defence will influence the match. If one of the 2 judokas is attacking more with say uchi-mata, the opponent will be wary to these and be more open to other forms of attacks. Receiving shidos is also a way of influencing how the match unfolds, at 2 shidos you will see more attacks from one of the fighters.</li> </ul> <p>I need to expand on that and make it clearer.
